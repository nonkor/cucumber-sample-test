# cucumber-sample-test
End-to-end sample tests for checking website based on cucumber, watir-webdriver and watirsome frameworks

## Notes

* Website example: github.com
* [setting.yml](https://github.com/nonkor/cucumber-sample-test/blob/master/config/settings.yml) contains `:step_timeout` parameter that specifies delay between every cucumber step. It was introduced to escape github abuse detection mechanism.
